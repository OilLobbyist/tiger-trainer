# 🚀 How to Share & Publish Tiger Trainer

You've built a great app! Here is how to get it out into the world, starting from the easiest method.

## Method 1: The "Instant" Way (Share the Link)
The fastest way to show your cat (or friends) the app is to use the built-in sharing feature in AI Studio:
1. Look at the top right of your screen for a **"Share"** or **"Publish"** button.
2. This will give you a public link that anyone can open in a browser.
3. **Tip:** Open this link on your iPad or Smart TV browser for the best cat training experience!

## Method 2: The "Permanent" Way (No Coding Required)
If you want to host this app on your own "real" website address (like `my-cat-app.netlify.app`) without ever touching a terminal or writing code:

1. **Download your code:**
   - Look for the **Download** icon (usually a cloud with an arrow) in the AI Studio sidebar or file menu.
   - This will give you a `.zip` file of everything we just built.
   - Unzip that folder on your computer.

2. **Use Netlify "Drop":**
   - Go to [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.app/drop).
   - You don't even need an account yet.
   - **Wait!** Before you drag the folder, you need the "Build" version. Since you can't run commands, you can use a service like **GitHub** to do it for you (see Method 3) OR ask me to help you prepare a "Static Version" if you just want a single file to open.

## Method 3: The "Pro" Way (Vercel/Netlify via GitHub)
This is how professional apps are kept online forever.

1. **Get the code to GitHub:**
   - Create a free account at [GitHub.com](https://github.com).
   - Create a "New Repository" named `tiger-trainer`.
   - Use the **"Upload files"** button on GitHub to drag and drop all the files you downloaded from AI Studio.

2. **Connect to Vercel:**
   - Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in with your GitHub account.
   - Click **"Add New Project"**.
   - Select your `tiger-trainer` repository.
   - Click **"Deploy"**. 
   - **Vercel does all the "npm run build" stuff for you automatically.** You don't have to type anything!

### 🐾 Tips for Cat Owners
*   **Full Screen:** I've added a "Maximize" button in the game. Use it! It hides the browser bars so your cat doesn't accidentally click "Back".
*   **OLED Safety:** The backgrounds are now pure black. This is safe for expensive OLED TVs and saves battery on iPads.
*   **Cleaning:** Remember to wipe the screen after a session—paws can be messy!
